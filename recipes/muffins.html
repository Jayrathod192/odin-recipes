    <h1>Sugar cookie Recipe</h1>
    <img src="/img/muffins.avif" alt="muffins recipe image" />
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever you make these cookies for someone, be sure to bring along
      several copies of the recipe! You will be asked for it, I promise! NOTE: I
      make icing with confectioners' sugar and milk. I make it fairly thin, as I
      'paint' the icing on the cookies with a pastry brush. Thin enough to
      spread easily but not so thin that it just makes your cookies wet and runs
      off.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup ground pistachio nuts</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped pistachio nuts, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a 12-cup muffin
        tin with paper liners. Lightly spray liners and pan with cooking spray.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir flour, sugar, brown sugar, ground pistachio nuts, 1/2 cup chopped
        pistachio nuts, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt
        together in a bowl. Make a well in the center.
      </li>

      <li>
        Whisk together milk, melted butter, eggs, vanilla extract, and almond
        extract together in a bowl. Pour milk mixture into the well of the dry
        ingredients and mix with a spatula just until batter is combined but a
        few lumps remain; do not overmix.
      </li>

      <li>
        Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.
        Sprinkle remaining chopped pistachios on top.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until tops spring back when lightly pressed,
        about 15 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Cool in the tin for
        5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
      </li>
    </ol>

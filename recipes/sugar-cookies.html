    <h1>Sugar cookie Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../img/cookies.avif" alt="cookies recipe image" />
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever you make these cookies for someone, be sure to bring along
      several copies of the recipe! You will be asked for it, I promise! NOTE: I
      make icing with confectioners' sugar and milk. I make it fairly thin, as I
      'paint' the icing on the cookies with a pastry brush. Thin enough to
      spread easily but not so thin that it just makes your cookies wet and runs
      off.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>butter</li>
      <li>sugar</li>
      <li>eggs</li>
      <li>vanilla extract</li>
      <li>flour</li>
      <li>backing powder</li>
      <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cream together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer
        until smooth. Beat in eggs and vanilla. Stir in flour, baking powder,
        and salt. Cover, and chill dough for at least 1 hour (or overnight).
      </li>

      <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>

      <li>
        Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Roll out dough to 1/4 to 1/2
        inch thickness. Cut into shapes with any cookie cutter. Place cookies 1
        inch apart on ungreased baking sheets.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cookies are lightly browned, 6 to 8
        minutes. Carefully transfer cookies to a wire rack and cool completely
        before decorating.
      </li>
    </ol>
